# Nextcloud Docker Compose Configuration  

A sample Docker Compose file for Nextcloud, Redis, and MariaDB.  

## Docker Networks Information  

* The Docker Compose file assumes you have already created Docker networks called ```Nextcloud```, ```Redis```, and ```MariaDB```. You can create these networks before starting the Compose file by executing the following command: ```docker network create <NETWORK_NAME>```  

## Environment Variables Configuration  

Create a file called ```.env``` in the same directory as the Docker Compose file containing the following properties:  

```env
NEXTCLOUD_VOLUMES=<DOCKER_BIND_MOUNTS_PATH>
MAIL_DOMAIN=<YOUR_DOMAIN.COM>
HOST=<YOUR_HOST.YOUR_DOMAIN.COM>
DB_USER=<YOUR_DB_USER>
DB_PASSWORD=<YOUR_DB_PASSWORD>
DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD>
SMTP_HOST="<YOUR_SMTP_HOST>"
SMTP_USER="<YOUR_SMTP_USER>"
SMTP_PASSWORD="<YOUR_SMTP_PASSWORD>"
ADMIN_USER=<YOUR_ADMIN_USER>
ADMIN_PASSWORD="<YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD>"
TRUSTED_PROXIES="<YOUR_TRUSTED_PROXY_IP_RANGE>"
```

## Starting the container  

In your terminal, ```cd``` to the directory containing the ```docker-compose.yml``` and ```.env``` files. Run the following command: ```docker compose up -d```  
Your containers should be up and running and your Nextcloud instance be accessible on port 80 in the container. Setup your Docker Networks and reverse proxy accordingly.
