## Getting Started  

1. Clone the repository:  

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/mwdle/NextcloudConfig.git
    ```  

2. Create a file called ```.env``` in the same directory as the Docker Compose file containing the following properties:  

    ```properties
    NEXTCLOUD_VOLUMES=<PATH_TO_NEXTCLOUD_VOLUMES_FOLDER> # A folder on your system to store bind mounts for Nextcloud Docker containers.
    MAIL_DOMAIN=<YOUR_DOMAIN.COM>
    HOST=<YOUR_HOST.YOUR_DOMAIN.COM>
    DB_USER=<YOUR_DB_USER>
    DB_PASSWORD=<YOUR_DB_PASSWORD>
    DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD>
    SMTP_HOST="<YOUR_SMTP_HOST>"
    SMTP_USER="<YOUR_SMTP_USER>"
    SMTP_PASSWORD="<YOUR_SMTP_PASSWORD>"
    ADMIN_USER=<YOUR_ADMIN_USER>
    ADMIN_PASSWORD="<YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD>"
    TRUSTED_PROXIES="<YOUR_TRUSTED_PROXY_IP_RANGE>"
    ```  

3. Open a terminal in the directory containing the docker-compose file.  
4. Create docker networks for the containers:  

    ```shell
    docker network create Nextcloud
    docker network create Redis
    docker network create MariaDB
    ```  

5. Start the containers:  

    ```shell
    docker compose up -d
    ```  

Your containers should be up and running and your Nextcloud instance be accessible on port 80 in the container. Setup your Docker Networks and reverse proxy accordingly.
