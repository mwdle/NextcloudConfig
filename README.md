# Nextcloud Docker Compose Configuration  

A sample Docker Compose file for Nextcloud.  

## Important Details  

* The Docker Compose file assumes you have already created Docker networks called ```Nextcloud```, ```Redis```, and ```MariaDB```. You can create a network before starting the container by executing the following command: ```docker network create <NETWORK_NAME>```  
* You must change the ```DOCKER_VOLUMES``` path in the ```.env``` file to a folder on your system where you wish to store container files (used in Docker Compose bind mounts).  

## Starting the container  

In your terminal, ```cd``` to the directory containing the ```docker-compose.yml``` and ```.env``` files. Run the following command: ```docker compose up -d```  
Your containers should be up and running and your Nextcloud instance be accessible on port 80 in the container. Setup your Docker Networks and reverse proxy accordingly.
